          Building on its punk rock roots, the shop has expanded to represent
          every facet of indie music, from dance 12″s to IDM long players and
          sci-fi soundtracks. With a diverse customer base stretching from local
          eccentrics to visiting celebs, Rough Trade West remains the vibrant
          cultural hub that Travis envisaged nearly 40 years ago.

        <h2>12 Inch Records</h2>
        <p>
          The twelve-inch single (often simply called a 12-inch or 12″) is a
          type of gramophone record that has wider groove spacing and shorter
          playing time compared to LPs. This allows for louder levels to be cut
          on the disc by the mastering engineer, which in turn gives a wider
          dynamic range, and thus better sound quality.
        </p>
        <p>
          This record type is commonly used in disco and dance music genres,
          where DJs use them to play in clubs. They are played at either ​33 1⁄3
          or 45 rpm.

          Within six months, punk broke out, manifesting itself in flurries of
          7”s that spread across the iconic shop wall like wildfire. Members of
          The Raincoats and Swell Maps worked behind the counter and almost
          overnight Rough Trade was at the epicentre of DIY and punk culture in
          London. By the end of ’78 Rough Trade encompassed not just a shop, but
          also a record label and an embryonic distribution company.
        </p>

        <p>
          By the ’80s Travis was increasingly being diverted away from the
          record shop. When the business went through a financial rough patch in
          1982, he sold the shop to employees Nigel House, Jude Crighton and
          Pete Donne. They paid £7,000 for stock and relocated to 130 Talbot
          Road where Rough Trade stands today.

        <h2>Who We Are</h2>
        <p>
          Monk Records, located at 114 S. Franklin St., has sold music since
          1897, and holds the title for oldest record store in the United
          States.
        </p>
        <p>
          Monk’s started as a news agency developed by Rupert Monk during 1913
          by merging two already-established news agencies in Kirksville,
          according to The Adair Historian archive. Monk’s brother, Edwin,
          merged his music business with the news agency during 1920. Edwin
          Monk’s business has carried sheet music, wax cylinders and players,
          and Victrola records since 1897, which marks its starting date as a
          record store.
        </p>
        <p>
          Current owner Karl Hildebrand said he has owned the store since 1999,
          when he purchased it from Mabel Monk Wilbanks, the previous owner.
          Hildebrand said he is a distant cousin of the Monk's, which made it a
          family transaction.
